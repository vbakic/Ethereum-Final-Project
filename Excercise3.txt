Excercise 3 - additional comments:

Fallback function does not check if any funds are deposited (if mgs.value is > 0), 
or the address that is calling the function, it just splits whatever there is in the contract to other two addresses. 

Because of that, anyone (and particularly the owners of "one" and "two" addresses) could call fallback 
function and drain contract out of funds, although it would still go 
to the "one" and "two" addresses, provided that they accept transfers.
